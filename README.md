# Morning Pages Coding
This was my first iteration of Morning Pages coding. The motivation behind it is to introduce more play into work, and it works like so: allot an hour or two to code up a "silly" or "unimpactful" application. I personally used to get so bogged down by worrying about how useful or rigorous my coding projects were that I would just walk away before finishing them. I was too serious about it. After reading Julia Cameron's book __The Artist's Way__, I decided to translate "Morning Pages" into my coding projects. This way, I can get the coding practice I need without worrying about the actual usefulness of my app. 

The concept is more thoroughly explained in this LinkedIn post (link [here](https://www.linkedin.com/posts/anabelle-colmenares_what-if-women-introduced-more-play-into-activity-7249461786188378114-pdsO])) I made about it. 

Try it. Who knows what you may learn.
